<ol>
	<li>The probability of an $event$ is less then or equal to 1. <br>
i.e. `0 <= P(bbb"E") <= 1`.</li>
	<li>The probability of the $sample-space$ is strictly 1. <br>
i.e. `P(bbb"S") = 1`.</li>
	<li>For any number of $event$s w/ $mutual-exclusion$, the $probability$ of their
$union$ is the sum of their probabilities.</li>
