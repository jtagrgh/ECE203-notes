Two $event$s are independent if the $probability$ of their $intersection$ is equal to their probabilities multiplied. <br>
i.e. `P(EF) = P(E)P(F)` <br><br>
Two $event$s are also independent if the $probability$ of (the first w/ $conditioning$ on the second) is equal to the $probability$ of the first. <br>
i.e. `P(A|B) = P(A)`
<br><br>
Derivation:<br>
`P(E|F) = (P(EF))/(P(F)) = (P(E)P(F))/(P(F)) = P(E)`

Note: 
<ol>
	<li>
	If two $event$s `E` and `F` are independent, then so are any combination them and their $complement$s, e.g. `E` and `F^c` are independent.
	</li>
	<li>
	A set of any number of $event$s is called independent if every subset is independent.
