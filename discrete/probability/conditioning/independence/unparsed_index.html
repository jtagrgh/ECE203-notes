<p>
$Event$s `E` and `F` have $conditioning/independence$ on another $event$ `G`
<b>when</b> the $probability$ w/ $conditioning$ of (the $intersection$ of
(`E` and `F`) on `G`) is equal to the product of the $probability$ w/ $conditioning$ of (`E` on `G`) and the $probability$ w/ $conditioning$ of (`F` on `G`), <br><br>
i.e. `P(EF|G) = P(E|G)P(F|G)`. <br><br>
Additionally, `P(E|FG) = P(E|G)`.
