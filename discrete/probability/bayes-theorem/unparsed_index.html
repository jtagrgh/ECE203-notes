Reverse the order of $conditioning$. Given two $event$s `E` and `F`, with the probabilities of `E` w/ $conditioning$ on each partition of `F` known, the probability of some partition of `F` w/ $conditioning$ on `E`, is given as follows,<br><br>
`P(F_j|E) = (P(EF_j))/(P(E)) = (P(E|F_j)P(F_j))/(sum_iP(E|F_i)P(F_i))`.
