	<li>The $probability$ of the null set is 0.</li>
	<li>$probability/axiom$ 3 works for finitely many sets.</li>
	<li>The $probability$ of the $complement$ of an $event$ is
1 minus the $probability$ of that $event$ (non-complement). <br>
i.e. `P(bbb"E"^c) = 1 - P(bbb"E")`.</li>
	<li>The $probability$ of an $event$ is less then or equal to 
the $probability$ of any of it's supersets. <br>
i.e. if `bbb"E" sube bbb"F"` then `P(bbb"E") <= P(bbb"F")`.</li>
	<li>The $probability$ of the $union$ of two $event$s is the
sum of their probabilities, minus the $probability$ of their
$intersection$.</li>
