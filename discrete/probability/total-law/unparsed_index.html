An $event$ is equal to the $union$ of (it's $intersection$s w/ the partitions of another $event$). e.g. for 2 partitions, <br>
`E = EF uu EF^c`. <br>
This extends to $probability$ b.c of $probability/axiom/3$, <br>
`P(E) = P(EF) + P(EF^c)`. <br>
This, can be re-written with $conditioning$ as, <br>
`P(E) = P(E|F)P(F) + P(E|F^c)P(F^c)`.
